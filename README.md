# PHP Naivechain

An implementation of block chain inspired by the [lhartikk/naivechain](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain) npm package in PHP. This package doesn't include a server or a mechanism for saving/storing/replacing the chain.

### Usage

You can see usage through the tests. There is not built-in server or mechanism for saving/storing/replacing the chain. It is built purely in memory.
